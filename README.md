# Count-To-30
A toy programme I created for myself.  

## Game Rules
- There are two players in the game: User and Computer.
- User will start by counting either 1 or 2 steps forward, followed by the computer doing the same thing.
- Whoever steps on the 30 step mark loses. The other player wins.

## Configuration
- Computer generates a random number between 1 or 2, instead of following the method that guarantees winning.
- Open the `~/CountTo30/out/artifacts/CountTo30_jar/CountTo30.jar` to play the game.
